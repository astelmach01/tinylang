      "P-hacking, short for \"researcher degrees of freedom\" or \"data dredging,\" refers to the improper use of statistical analyses to obtain a desired or significant result when conducting scientific research or data analysis. It involves manipulating or selectively choosing data or analysis methods until a statistically significant result is achieved or a desired conclusion is obtained, even if the original hypothesis was weak or non-existent.\n",
      "\n",
      "It generally involves the researcher engaging in multiple iterations of data analysis, such as trying different statistical tests, excluding or including particular data points, or exploring various subsets of the data, until a significant or favorable outcome is found. This practice can lead to the creation of false positives, meaning that the observed effects or relationships in the data are not actually meaningful but are rather mere chance findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "P-hacking is considered problematic because it undermines the integrity and reliability of scientific research. It can contribute to the replication crisis, where many findings cannot be replicated by other researchers. P-hacked results can be misleading, leading to incorrect conclusions, wastage of resources, and the inability to build upon existing knowledge.\n",
      "To mitigate p-hacking, researchers are encouraged to pre-register their research plans, hypothesis, and analysis methods before data collection, to prevent post hoc adjustments that may bias the results. Additionally, practicing transparency in reporting all analyses conducted and publishing both positive and negative findings can help reduce p-hacking and improve the overall reliability of scientific research."

It is considered a form of data manipulation or statistical fishing.\\n\\nWhen conducting scientific research or analyzing data, researchers often set a significance level (denoted as 'p') to determine whether the observed results are statistically significant or not. By convention, a p-value less than 0.05 (5%) is generally considered statistically significant. However, if researchers go through multiple iterations of analyzing their data in different ways or testing multiple hypotheses, they may unintentionally or intentionally manipulate the analysis until they achieve a statistically significant result.\\n\\nP-hacking can take various forms, such as selectively reporting only significant results while ignoring non-significant ones, cherry-picking data points, adjusting variables or parameters until the desired outcome is achieved, or performing multiple analyses without proper correction for multiple testing.\\n\\nThis practice can lead to false conclusions or overestimation of the true effect of a given variable or hypothesis, which ultimately undermines the validity and reliability of scientific research.\\n\\nTo combat p-hacking, it is important for researchers to have a priori hypotheses, clearly define the analysis plan before data collection, and pre-register the study design and analysis methods.
