```bash
python get-pip.py
```


## Quick Start


```python
from tinylang.chains import Chain
from tinylang.llms import OpenAI
from tinylang.memory import ConversationMemory

model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

chatGPT = OpenAI(
    openai_api_key=openai_api_key,
    openai_organization=openai_organization,
    model=model,
)

memory = ConversationMemory()

chain = Chain(
    llm=chatGPT,
    memory=memory,
)

prompt = "Hello"
print(chain.run(prompt))
```
